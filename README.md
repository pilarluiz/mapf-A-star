# A* CUDA

Implementation of massively parallel version of A* algorithm for execution on NVIDIA GPU for Supercomputing university course.
This verision of algorithm is based on *Massively Parallel A\* Search on a GPU* paper by Yichao Zhou and Jianyang Zeng
(https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/download/9620/9366).

Implementation contains generic A\* algorithm and its example use for solving sliding puzzle and pathfinding on 2D board,
as described in linked paper.
