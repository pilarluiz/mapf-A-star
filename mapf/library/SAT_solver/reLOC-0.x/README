An experimental package for solving
item relocation problems.


Compilation
-----------

./config-relase
make optimized


Problem Solving
---------------

The current version (0.20-kruh_043) of the package includes
solvers for various item relocation problems including:

  - multi-agent path finding (MAPF)
  - token swapping (TSWAP)
  - token rotation (TROT)
  - token permutation (TPERM).

Please see the paper for more details. Most
of solving algorithms in this package is
based on reduction to SAT. Indivudual solvers
can be invoked from command line.

The command line programs are solver_reLOC
(calls the external glucose executable) and
insolver_reLOC (the glucose solver is compiled
in the program, this is faster option, but one
cannot see the formula in the DIMACS format).
Following examples of command line options show
how to run the solver.

./solver_reLOC --encoding=mdd --output-file=solution.txt --input-file=clique_07_t07.cpf

./insolver_reLOC --encoding=mdd --output-file=solution.txt --input-file=clique_07_t07.cpf

Use --help to see all command line options
and be aware that not all combinations work
together.

The option --encoding=mdd is for running the solver
MAPF. Token swapping (TSWAP) can be used with
--encoding=temdd of tmdd (if the graph is full).
Token rotation (TROT) is enable through
--encoding=pmdd (looks like this is a mistake and
token permutation will be enable, but this is correct).
And finally, token permutation (TPERM) will be
enable by --encoding=rmdd.

Please enjoy your problem solving...
